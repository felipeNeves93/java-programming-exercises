The Ceasar cipher is a basic encryption technique used by Julius Ceasar to securely communicate with his generals. Each letter is replaced by another letter N positions down the english alphabet. For example, for a rotation of 5, the letter 'c' would be replaced by an 'h'. In case of a 'z', the alphabet rotates and it is transformed into a 'd'.
Implement a decoder for the Ceasar cipher where N = 5.
TIP: Use code.toCharArray() to get an array of characters.
