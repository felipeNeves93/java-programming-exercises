In the popular Minesweeper game you have a board with some mines and those cells that don't contain a mine have a number in it that indicates the total number of mines in the neighboring cells. Starting off with some arrangement of mines we want to create a Minesweeper game setup.

Example

For

matrix = [[true, false, false],
[false, true, false],
[false, false, false]]
the output should be

solution(matrix) = [[1, 2, 1],
[2, 1, 1],
[1, 1, 1]]
