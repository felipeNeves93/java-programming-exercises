# Java Programming Exercises
This is a simple maven project with a variety of simple to more advanced exercises solved using Java.

I've utilized TestNg for the testing classes.

Each problem solved will be inside a package containing the class(es) necessary to solve the problem, one test class for testing and explanation, and a txt file with the description of the problem.

Just clone the repository into your favorite coding tool and run the tests classes to see the resolution of the problems.
